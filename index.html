    <h1>Greetings loved ones! Let's take a journey.</h1>

      <!--Description -->
      <h2>The Journey</h2>
      <p>The journey begins for real in 2018. Here I am contemplating how to get a summer job <br>
         that allows me to earn as well learn. I am at my wits end as nothing seems to be in the <br>
       area that I can qualify for with my first year I.T student skills. So I decide to spend that summer <br>
     Getting one specific employable skill under my belt. Along comes Codecademy with this  10-week course that costs like <br>
  200 bucks. I am already a sucker for any opportunity to invest in myself or my future; match made in heaven. <br>
  I did get lucky and land a job at my school's helpdesk department, which also doubles as work placement- <br>
   another 2 birds with one stone. <strong>Ka-Ching!</strong> So, for this summer all I do pretty much after work is <br>
   my beloved Codecademy course. 10 weeks of this stuff, but strangely ,I love it. The ups and downs and all.
  </p>

  <p>I hope to have the footer fixed so it is always at the bottom of the screen as you scroll ;) XD</p>
